    <h2>History of Java :</h2>
    <p>
      <i>Java</i> was developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun
      Microsystems in the early 1990s.<br />
      It was originally designed for programming consumer devices like set-top
      boxes, but its potential for internet-based applications soon became
      evident.<br />
      Java was officially released to the public in 1995, and its adoption
      soared with the rise of the internet due to its ability to create
      dynamic and interactive web content.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features of Java :</h2>

    <ol>
      <li><i>Platform Independence</i></li>
      <li><i>Object-Oriented</i></li>
      <li><i>Robustness and Security</i></li>
      <li><i>Multithreading</i></li>
      <li><i>Rich Standard Library</i></li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="boxes">
    <h4>Platform Independence</h4>
    <p>
      One of the most significant features of Java is its platform
      independence. <br>Java programs can run on any device that has a Java
      Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, regardless of the underlying hardware
      or operating system.<br> This "write once, run anywhere" capability has made
      Java an ideal choice for developing cross-platform applications.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="boxes">
    <h4>Object-Oriented</h4>
    <p>
      <i><strong>Java</strong></i> is an object-oriented programming (OOP)
      language,<br> which means it organizes software design around objects and
      data, rather than actions and logic.<br> This paradigm promotes modularity,
      reusability, and ease of maintenance, making it easier to develop
      complex software systems.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="boxes">
    <h4>Robustness and Security</h4>
    <p>
      <i>Java's</i> strict compile-time and runtime checks help ensure
      robustness by detecting errors early in the development process.
      <br>Additionally, Java's security features, such as sandboxing and bytecode
      verification, make it inherently secure against various vulnerabilities
      like buffer overflows and memory leaks.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="boxes">
    <h4>Multithreading</h4>
    <p>
      <i>Java</i> supports multithreading, allowing programs to execute
      multiple threads simultaneously. <br>This feature is particularly useful for
      developing responsive and scalable applications, such as web servers and
      GUI-based programs, where multiple tasks need to be executed
      concurrently.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="boxes">
    <h4>Rich Standard Library</h4>
    <p>
      <i>Java</i> comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides
      pre-built modules and classes for common programming tasks.<br> This library
      includes utilities for networking, file I/O, database access, GUI
      development, and much more, reducing the need for developers to reinvent
      the wheel and speeding up the development process.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="boxes">
    <h2>Applications of Java Programming :</h2>
    <p>
      <i>Java's</i> versatility and robustness have made it a popular choice
      for developing a wide range of applications across various domains.<br> Here
      are some of the key areas where Java finds extensive application
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><i>Web Development</i></li>
      <li><i>Mobile Development</i></li>
      <li><i>Enterprise Applications</i></li>
      <li><i>Desktop Applications</i></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="boxes">
    <h4>Web Development</h4>
    <p>
      <i>Java</i> is widely used for building dynamic and interactive web
      applications.<br> Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) provides a suite of APIs
      and frameworks, such as Servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP),<br> JavaServer
      Faces (JSF), and Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), for developing scalable and
      enterprise-grade web solutions.<br> Popular web frameworks like Spring Boot
      and Apache Struts leverage Java's capabilities to simplify web
      development and enhance productivity
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="boxes">
    <h4>Mobile Development</h4>
    <p>
      With the introduction of Android, Java has become the primary
      programming language for developing Android applications.<br> Android
      Studio, the official IDE for Android development, supports Java as the
      primary language for writing Android apps.<br> Developers can leverage
      Java's rich ecosystem of libraries and tools to create feature-rich and
      high-performance mobile applications for Android devices.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="boxes">
    <h4>Enterprise Applications</h4>
    <p>
      <i>Java's</i> robustness, scalability, and platform independence make it
      well-suited for building enterprise-grade applications.<br> Java EE offers a
      comprehensive set of APIs and specifications for developing distributed,
      transactional, and mission-critical applications.<br> Enterprises rely on
      Java for developing applications like customer relationship management
      (CRM) systems, enterprise resource planning<br> (ERP) software, financial
      systems, and supply chain management (SCM) solutions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="boxes">
    <h4>Desktop Applications</h4>
    <p>
      <i>Java's</i> rich set of libraries and cross-platform compatibility
      make it a viable choice for developing desktop applications.<br> JavaFX, a
      modern GUI toolkit for Java, enables developers to create visually
      appealing and responsive desktop applications with rich multimedia
      capabilities.<br> Tools like Java Swing and Apache Pivot also facilitate the
      development of desktop applications with Java.
